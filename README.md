# Image Carousel with CSS & JS

## About The Project

This mini project is intended for anyone who wants to apply this effect to their projects or simply learn the methods.
You can add images and it will change with interval. Upon the last image, it will go back to the first image. You can manually change direction and flip though the images.
You can use it for testimonials or a portfolio blog to showcase your project images.
